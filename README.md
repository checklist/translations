If you are interested in adding your language to the Checklist apps, please download teh original English file, translate it into your language and then either send it to us via the Contact us page  (http://checklist.com/contact) or make a pull request for a file in your language.

The master file is regularly being updated by our development team. It includes localization strings from all of our apps, website and email templates. We work with our users to add new languages and improve existing translations all the time.
